Cinemachine can give us the parallax effect.

Simply move the X, Y, or Z position of CM vcam1 while a character is some Z distance away from the background.

------------------------------
To do animation like move Clarevine, you use cinemachine. 

Insert a "Dolly Camera with Track".

Then, in the "DollyTrack1" game object, create some number of waypoints with different X, Y, and Z values.

Then, add CM vcam1 to the timeline windowpane.

To record movement, in the Timeline windowpane, click the red circle button.

On frame 0, assign positions for a character. On any number of frames after assign differents positions.
When done, press the circle button again to stop recording.

If you click the play button in the Timeline tab, the character you animated will smoothly move to the assigned
positions.

Click the main start gameplay button and your animation will immediately play.
